For my OOP assignment i will be looking at the internet access per 100 people in ireland and in the United states.
I will be visualising this data in two types of graphs. 1. A bar chart for each country and 2. A donut chart for each country.
I am interested in this data because I know of many places that have next to no internet access and am interested in how it has changed in the last 10 years.
I will be reading in the data from two csv files and will hopefully display a menu for the user to pick the visualisation they want and also display the average growth and the comparison growth from each country/ year.
